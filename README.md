# The Software Sustainability Institute / Provenance Tool Suite 
Consultancy

A collaboration between [The Software Sustainability Institute](http://www.software.ac.uk) and the [Provenance Tool Suite](http://provenance.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) team at [Electronics and Computer Science](http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk) at the [University of Southampton](http://www.soton.ac.uk).

## Aims

The aims of our collaboration are as follows.

* Deployment experience report. A report summarising experiences of deploying Provenance Tool Suite and setting up a local development environment for building and testing its packages and services.
* Round-trip interoperability test specification. Specification of round-trip interoperability tests to be implemented with reference to PROV and packages and services of the Provenance Tool Suite.
* Round-trip interoperability test harness design. Design for a test harness which systematically checks convertibility and round-trip conversions across combinations of these.
* Round-trip interoperability test harness. Test harness implementation, with implementation of round-trip interoperability tests specified in the Round-trip interoperability test specification. The test harness will be complemented with documentation on how to deploy, maintain and extend the test harness.
